This project involves building a small robot car capable of autonomously navigating through a maze using distance sensors. The robot detects walls and obstacles, calculates its position relative to the wall, and makes decisions on how to proceed. 


A custom chasis was designed and built for the robot and the arduino was used to control the sensors and motors in accordance to the maze traversing algorithms. Read more about this project in Final_Report.docx.
